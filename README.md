# 🧠 Data Preprocessing Notes & Code

This repository provides a complete and easy-to-follow guide to **data preprocessing** — a crucial step before applying machine learning algorithms.

It includes both **theoretical explanations** and **hands-on Python code** for all essential preprocessing steps, making it ideal for learners and practitioners who know the basics of:

- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
